Dev thought process

In this secton I will record my assumptions and though process whilst developing.

For this task I have chosen to use JavaScript due to my preference to front end development. I will also be uising Node.js File parser module along with th csv parser 'Papa Parse'

I will go about this task in an iterative way, starting small and building upon it. The first thing I will do it to access the csv file line by line and print to the console.
